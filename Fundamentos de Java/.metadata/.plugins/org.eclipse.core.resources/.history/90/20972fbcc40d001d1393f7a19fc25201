/* 
 * 
 * 
 * The organizers of a car championship want to have a program 
 * 
 * to manage some of the information that they did not have 
 * 
 * computerized until now. They want to know about each team 
 * 
 * participating in the championship, the team name, the budget they 
 * 
 * have and the country of origin. Each team can have more than 
 * 
 * one car and they want to know the power, top speed, color and 
 * 
 * market price of each. Of the workers in the different teams, 
 * 
 * they want to know their first name, last name, age, length of 
 * 
 * time in the team and their salary. The base salary is €50,000. 
 * 
 * 
 * In addition, they want to know the driver's height and weight. 
 * 
 * The salary of the drivers is the base salary of the workers plus 
 * 
 * €10,000 for each year of seniority in the team, plus €50,000 of 
 * 
 * dangerousness. For the mechanics, they want to know if they have 
 * 
 * advanced degrees in mechanics or not. And their salary is 
 * 
 * calculated by adding 10,000 for each year of seniority at the
 * 
 *  team plus the base salary. It is requested  that the application 
 *  
 *  be able to register, deregister and see drivers and mechanics, 
 *  
 *  and to see teams and cars. Teams and cars can be entered directly 
 *  
 *  in the code.
